# User Workflows for Agentic AI Navigation Solution for Visually Impaired

The following workflows outline the key tasks and scenarios that the agentic AI mobile application, **UrbanSenseAI**, powered by IBM watsonx, will support for visually impaired users navigating urban environments. The solution uses a smartphone camera for real-time visual analysis, integrates contextual data (e.g., GPS, transit schedules), and delivers audio-based feedback to enhance independence, safety, and accessibility in cities.

## Workflow 1: Identifying and Boarding the Correct Bus
- **User Goal**: Board the correct public transit bus by identifying its number and destination.
- **Steps**:
  1. The user activates UrbanSenseAI at a bus stop (via voice command or button press).
  2. The user points the smartphone camera toward approaching buses.
  3. The app’s Vision Agent detects and reads the bus number and destination sign using computer vision.
  4. The Context Agent cross-references the detected bus details with real-time transit schedules (via API or cached data).
  5. The Communication Agent delivers audio feedback (e.g., “Bus number 42 to Downtown is approaching from 20 meters”).
  6. If multiple buses are detected, the app confirms the correct one based on user preferences (e.g., destination or route).
  7. The Safety Agent alerts the user to safe boarding conditions (e.g., “Bus stopped, door is 2 meters ahead”).
- **Outcome**: The user confidently boards the correct bus without assistance.
- **Agentic AI Roles**:
  - Vision Agent: Detects bus numbers and signs.
  - Context Agent: Matches bus data with schedules.
  - Safety Agent: Ensures safe boarding.
  - Communication Agent: Provides audio instructions.
- **Watsonx Integration**:
  - Watsonx.ai: Computer vision for bus number detection.
  - Watsonx.data: Integrates transit API data.
  - Watsonx Assistant: Delivers audio feedback.

## Workflow 2: Safely Crossing a Road
- **User Goal**: Cross a road safely by identifying pedestrian signals and avoiding hazards.
- **Steps**:
  1. The user activates UrbanSenseAI near a crosswalk (via voice or automatic detection based on GPS).
  2. The user points the camera toward the crosswalk and pedestrian signal.
  3. The Vision Agent detects the pedestrian signal status (e.g., green/red light, countdown timer) and nearby obstacles (e.g., vehicles, cyclists).
  4. The Safety Agent analyzes traffic flow and potential hazards (e.g., oncoming vehicles, uneven pavement).
  5. The Communication Agent provides real-time audio cues (e.g., “Green light, 15 seconds to cross, no vehicles detected” or “Wait, red light, vehicle approaching”).
  6. The app continues monitoring during crossing, alerting the user to dynamic changes (e.g., “Cyclist approaching from the right, slow down”).
- **Outcome**: The user crosses the road safely with real-time guidance.
- **Agentic AI Roles**:
  - Vision Agent: Detects signals and obstacles.
  - Safety Agent: Monitors traffic and hazards.
  - Communication Agent: Delivers audio alerts.
- **Watsonx Integration**:
  - Watsonx.ai: Computer vision for signal and obstacle detection.
  - Watsonx.data: Integrates traffic data if available.
  - Watsonx Assistant: Provides real-time audio feedback.

## Workflow 3: Locating a Shop or Point of Interest by Name
- **User Goal**: Find a specific shop or point of interest (e.g., pharmacy, coffee shop) in the vicinity.
- **Steps**:
  1. The user activates UrbanSenseAI and specifies the target (e.g., via voice command: “Find a Starbucks nearby”).
  2. The Context Agent uses GPS to identify the user’s location and queries a map database (e.g., OpenStreetMap) for nearby shops matching the request.
  3. The Vision Agent scans the environment via the camera to detect shop signs or landmarks.
  4. The Communication Agent provides audio feedback (e.g., “Starbucks is 50 meters to your right, next to a pharmacy”).
  5. If multiple options exist, the app lists them (e.g., “Two Starbucks locations: one 50 meters right, another 200 meters straight”).
  6. The Navigation Agent generates a walking route to the selected shop, prioritizing accessibility (e.g., avoiding stairs).
- **Outcome**: The user locates the desired shop efficiently.
- **Agentic AI Roles**:
  - Context Agent: Queries map data for shop locations.
  - Vision Agent: Detects shop signs or landmarks.
  - Navigation Agent: Generates accessible routes.
  - Communication Agent: Provides audio directions.

  - Watsonx.ai: Processes voice input and image recognition.
  - Watsonx.data: Integrates map and location data.
  - Watsonx Assistant: Handles voice interaction and audio output.

## Workflow 4: Navigating to a Destination with Accessible Wayfinding
- **User Goal**: Reach a destination (e.g., a friend’s house, a transit hub) using an accessible walking route.
- **Steps**:
  1. The user inputs the destination via voice command (e.g., “Navigate to Central Station”).
  2. The Context Agent retrieves the user’s current location via GPS and queries map data for accessible routes (e.g., OpenStreetMap with accessibility tags like tactile paving).
  3. The Navigation Agent generates an optimized route, avoiding barriers like stairs or construction zones.
  4. The Vision Agent monitors the camera feed for real-time obstacles (e.g., parked bikes, crowds) and confirms landmarks (e.g., “You’re passing a red building on your left”).
  5. The Safety Agent alerts the user to hazards along the route (e.g., “Uneven pavement ahead, slow down”).
  6. The Communication Agent delivers step-by-step audio directions (e.g., “Turn left in 10 meters, follow the sidewalk”).
  7. The app updates the route dynamically if obstacles or changes are detected.
- **Outcome**: The user reaches the destination safely and independently via an accessible route.
- **Agentic AI Roles**:
  - Context Agent: Retrieves location and map data.
  - Navigation Agent: Plans and updates accessible routes.
  - Vision Agent: Detects obstacles and landmarks.
  - Safety Agent: Monitors for hazards.

## Workflow 5: General Environmental Awareness
- **User Goal**: Gain a real-time understanding of the surrounding environment for situational awareness (e.g., exploring a new area).
- **Steps**:
  1. The user activates UrbanSenseAI in “explore mode” (via voice or button).
  2. The Vision Agent scans the camera feed to identify key objects, landmarks, or points of interest (e.g., benches, street signs, buildings).
  3. The Context Agent integrates GPS and map data to provide context (e.g., “You’re in City Square, a fountain is 10 meters ahead”).
  4. The Communication Agent delivers periodic audio descriptions (e.g., “To your left is a café, to your right is a bus stop”).
  5. The Safety Agent warns of nearby hazards (e.g., “Low-hanging branch 2 meters ahead”).
  6. The user can request specific details (e.g., “What’s the nearest food option?”), prompting the Context Agent to query relevant data.
- **Outcome**: The user gains confidence and awareness in unfamiliar environments.
- **Agentic AI Roles**:
  - Vision Agent: Identifies objects and landmarks.
